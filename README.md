# PortfolioRes

This project was created to give a full view of what I know, learned, and am working towards.
 
 I thought the best way to create a Portfolio is to make it in to a expansive GitHub Project.
For anyone reading this, I hope you find some interest in my work, regardless if it doesn't meet your expectations.

I know I have a lot to learn and need to expand more, but before I do that
my main goal is to work for my certifacation through Oracle for OCP, JAVA 11 SE Programmer I.
